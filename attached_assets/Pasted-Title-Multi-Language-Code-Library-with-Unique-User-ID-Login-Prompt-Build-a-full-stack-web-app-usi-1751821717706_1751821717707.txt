Title: Multi-Language Code Library with Unique User ID Login

Prompt:
Build a full-stack web app using Python (Flask) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript that allows users to:

Register with a 5-digit unique ID and password.

Login using their ID and password. If using just the ID login option, store credentials only temporarily (session-based).

View a Home Page with login/register options.

Access a Code Editor Page (full screen) with:

Syntax-highlighted editor (like CodeMirror or Ace).

Input fields for selecting language and naming the code.

Save code snippets to their personal library.

Navigate to a Library Page where saved code is:

Displayed in language-labeled boxes.

Sorted by name, date, or language.

Shareable via a unique link.

Copyable with a "Copy" button in the top right of each code box.

Shows the username of the code owner on top.

The app will not execute code â€” it's strictly a storage/view/share platform.

Use:

Flask for backend (auth, saving snippets).

HTML/CSS + JS for frontend.

CodeMirror or Ace Editor for code syntax highlighting.

Store data in JSON or SQLite (your choice).

Maintain clean, responsive UI and security basics (hashed passwords, etc.).

ðŸ§© Suggested App Structure (Pages):
Home Page (/)

Options: Register | Login with Password | Login with 5-digit ID

If using 5-digit ID: use session storage only; clear on browser close.
